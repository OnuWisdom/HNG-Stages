## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Image not showing:**

  - On Windows, file names are case-insensitive, but on some hosts they are case-sensitive. Ensure the image filename in `index.html` exactly matches the actual file name (`wisdoms.jpg` vs `Wisdoms.jpg`).

- **Form validation not working:**

  - Ensure `contact.js` is properly linked in `contact.html`.
  - Check browser console for JavaScript errors.

- **Navigation not working:**

  - Verify all HTML files are in the same directory.
  - Check that file names match the links in the navigation.

- **Cache issues:**
  - Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5) if changes don't appear.
  - Clear browser cache if styling changes aren't visible.

### Browser Compatibility

- Tested on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- JavaScript features require ES6+ support
- Form validation works with HTML5 input types
